## Abstract

<!--
This section is required.

The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This
should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section.
Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this
specification does.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is optional.

The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems
the AIP solves. It should not describe how the AIP solves those problems,
unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the AIP
should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that
a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your AIP, then
save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to
that copy.

## Goals

<!--
This section is required.

The Goals section should explicitely state in a bulleted list the technical
goals that this AIP seeks to solve. The best code is no code, so what
goal(s) are we accomplishing by adding more code?

## Non-goals

<!--
This section is optional.

If necessary, explain what goals this AIP specifically does not seek to
solve. This is useful when a problem is closely related to the problem(s)
identified earlier in the AIP. For any Non-goals, please clarify why they
are not included in this AIP.

## Specification

<!--
This section is required.

This should be the bulk of your proposal. Explain the design in enough
detail for someone familiar with the protocol to understand and implement
it. Include examples of how the feature is used. Give explanation for why
this implementation is the best approach.

This section can start out light before the prototyping phase. But it should
get specifi and detailed before the AIP is approved and implemented by the
core team.

It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word
definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Reference Implementation

<!--
This section is optional.

The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation
that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should
not include project build files. The reference implementation is not
a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be
understandable without it. If the reference implementation is too large to
reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in
`../assets/aip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Rationale

<!--
This section is required. 

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the
design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe
alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature
is supported in other languages.

The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.
